# mini-blockchain
A simple very little blockchain, just for learning.

You can test the blockchain by editing and launching **demo.py**.

* Added ability to modify the network difficulty (or amount of prefix zeros) in the **demo.py** file.
You can play around with it and see how it affects calulation time. I do not recommend to set a value higher than 6.
